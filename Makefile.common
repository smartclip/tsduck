#
#  Common GNU Make definitions.
#
#  This file is completely generic for all kinds of projects. It should be
#  located in the root directory of the project and included by all makefiles
#  in the directory tree.
#
#  The inclusion must be expressed in relative path format.
#  Example: include ../../Makefile.common
#
#  A few input variables may be defined by each makefile before including
#  the one. See the section "Input variables" below. After inclusion, several
#  useful variables are defined. See the section "Output variables" below.
#
#  By default, if the parent makefile does not define a first target before
#  including this file, the default make target is "default" and should be
#  defined in the parent makefile.
#
#  This common makefile also defines a few common targets which are usable
#  everywhere. See the section "Common targets" below.
#
#  All binaries are built into one single root directory named
#  bin/release|debug-arch-hostname where bin is located in the top-level
#  directory, where this Makefile.common is located. The variable $(BINDIR)
#  points to this directory. The variable $(OBJDIR) points to the directory
#  where object files are stored. This is, by default, the same place as
#  $(BINDIR), except when a local makefile defines $(OBJSUBDIR).
#
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#  Common targets

#  consequently available in all directories.

#    chain which is found in $(CROSS_PREFIX).

#    Installation prefix of the cross-compilation tool-chain.
#    The default is /usr/local.
#
#  CROSS_TARGET
#    Target name of the cross-compilation (e.g. arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi).
#    If undefined but CROSS is defined, we locate the first GCC executable
#    with path $(CROSS_PREFIX)/TARGET/bin/TARGET-gcc.

#  CVPATH
#    Contains directories where *.h and *.c files are searched. "vpath"
#    directives are defined accordingly.

#    C++ source files in the make working directory.
#
#  LDFLAGS_EXTRA
#    Additional options for the linker.
#    This variable can be defined after inclusion of this makefile.
#
#  LINUXBREW
#    If defined (any non-empty value), force a compilation in a Homebrew
#    environment on Linux. Homebrew on Linux (aka "Linuxbrew") installs a
#    non-standard environment where libraries are fetched from
#    $(HOMEBREW_PREFIX) instead of /usr. By default, ignore the Homebrew
#    environment on Linux and build using system libraries.
#
#  LLVM

#    compiler. Useful on Linux only. On macOS, clang is the default compiler.
#
#  M32
#    If defined (any non-empty value), compile for 32-bit target when running
#    in 64-bit host. More precisely, on a x86-84 host platform, generate code
#    for i686 target (cross-compilation). Requirement:
#    - Ubuntu: apt-get install gcc-multilib g++-multilib
#    - Fedora: dnf install glibc-devel.i686 libstdc++-devel.i686
#
#  MAKEINFO
#    Contains the absolute path of the makeinfo utility (part of Texinfo).
#    If empty, makeinfo is searched in $PATH.
#
#  NODEPS
#    List of make targets in the parent makefile which shall not enforce
#    the generation of header dependency files. This is a bit complicated
#    and, most of the time, there is no need to set this variable.
#
#    When make is invoked, the .dep files which list for each C/C++ source
#    file the .h header dependencies are automatically updated. This is
#    required for most targets, those which build files. Some targets are
#    informational or do not need to build object files. In this case,
#    rebuilding the .dep files is useless but harmless. However, in some
#    cases such as the standard "clean" targets, the .dep files should
#    not be rebuilt. In fact, they are deleted by the target. In these
#    cases, the "clean" targets must not implicitly rebuild the .dep
#    files. The standard "clean" targets are automatically added in NODEPS,
#    there is no need to set them. However, if a makefile defines some
#    non-standard "clean" targets, it should set them in NODEPS before
#    inclusion of this make file.
#
#  OBJSUBDIR
#    A subdirectory name to store object files below $(BINDIR). By default,
#    object files (compilation products, not final executable and shared
#    binaries) are stored in $(BINDIR).
#
#  RECURSE_ORDER
#    Define which subdirectories should be used in which order in the
#    $(RECURSE) shell command. Non-existent subdirectories are ignored.
#    See RECURSE in the section "Output variables" below.
#
#    Caveat: If you do not want to recurse into subdirectories, do not
#    define the variable as empty. If it is empty, the default will apply
#    (all subdirectories). Instead, define its value as something that does
#    not correspond to any existing directory (eg. RECURSE_ORDER = none).
#
#  RPMBUILDFLAGS_EXTRA
#    Additional options for the "rpmbuild" command.
#    This variable can be defined after inclusion of this makefile.
#
#  SCANBUILD
#    Contains the absolute path of the scan-build static code analyzer.
#    If empty, scan-build is searched in $PATH.
#
#  SCANBUILD_FLAGS
#    Contains additional options for scan-build. Typically empty since the
#    usual options are automatically added in this makefile.
#
#  SCANBUILD_SOURCES
#    List of source files or directories on which to run scan-build.
#    By default, use the source tree starting at current directory.
#
#  SOFLAGS
#    Specific options when creating shared objects (.so or .dylib files).
#    This variable can be defined after inclusion of this makefile.
#
#  SYSPREFIX
#    Optional installation prefix. If not defined, will be set on output.
#    See SYSPREFIX in "Output variables".
#
#  TARGET_FLAGS
#    Contains the target architecture options for gcc. Empty for a native
#    build.
#
#  TEXI2DVI
#    Contains the absolute path of the texi2dvi utility (part of Texinfo).
#    If empty, texi2dvi is searched in $PATH.
#
#  USRLIBDIR
#    Optional name of the library directory for the target architecture.
#    The default is either $(SYSPREFIX)/lib or $(SYSPREFIX)/lib64.
#    See USRLIBDIR in "Output variables".
